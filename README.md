# Interactive Gallery
To Create this Gallery I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages. Firrst of all i created Index.HTML file.
    After that i linked the Basic CSS File to my HTML and Then I also link the Animate.csss to that file for animation.
    then  I created Index.Js FILe for manioulate my HTML.
    ## IN my JS file Here is my Step what I did
        
        1 First make constant and call  all same class
        2 Second make an array for imagaes
        3 make an aray for image text
        4 make an empty array for push the HTML in it.
        5 made an array for Effects.
        And the i push whole HTML iN it to manupulaiton.Then i did animation using javascript and css for make it look nice.
        
# Animation:
For animation, I used animation.css file and I link my file to my index,html file.Then I used many different animation and I add different effects.

# Responsive:
 Responsive I used the,
1 ```display:grid``` 
2 ```grid-template-columns```
3 ```grid-gap```

# Challenges:
1) I had the problem to set the array.Because I made a syntax error.So I am getting error for array
2) I faced the problem with the adding the effects using javascript.but then I solved problem and i know the way and it is working in  my website.
3) Finally the last one is like I had with the event listeners syntax.But then I solved it.
